"""Carry out a consent withdrawal, replayably and without overclaiming.

Package 5i (docs/archive/architecture-1.0-umbau.md), target doc §10. Package 5a
already defined the destination -- ``WITHDRAWN`` is reachable from every
other lifecycle state, including from ``SEALED`` months later, and nothing
is reachable from it -- so this module only has to get there safely.

A second, unrelated reason to land in the same place: an operator stopping a
session that is stuck or misbehaving is not withdrawing anyone's consent and
must not delete their data on the way out. ``kind="admin_abort"`` (see
``abort()``) reuses the exact same ledger, tombstone file and terminal
lifecycle state -- stopping any live recording, keeping everything already
captured -- and skips only the steps that would remove or cancel anything.
The tombstone's ``kind`` field is the one place the two are told apart.

Three things shape the design, and each of them is a constraint the
obvious implementation gets wrong:

**The ledger has to outlive what it deletes.** A withdrawal that recorded
its own progress inside the session folder would erase that record halfway
through, and an interrupted run could never tell "already deleted" from
"never started". So the ledger lives in ``runtime/withdrawals/`` and the
session tree is only ever a target.

**Deleting everything would hide the withdrawal.** A session folder that
simply vanishes is indistinguishable from data loss -- exactly the silence
this project spends its effort removing. The contents go; the folder stays,
holding one ``WITHDRAWN.json`` and nothing else. A tombstone that carries
no participant data but proves the withdrawal happened.

**Published data cannot be un-published by wishing.** Uploads that already
completed put a copy on someone else's server. This process can stop the
queue, and does; it cannot delete the remote copy, and never says it did.
Those destinations are listed by name in the tombstone so an operator knows
exactly where to go. Claiming external deletion without evidence would be
the one failure here that no later check could catch.
